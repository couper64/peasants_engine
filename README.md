An experimental game engine supporting legacy OpenGL 1.0 with immediate mode rendering.

Written in C/C++ header files.

Supporting Windows.

My personal reasons to code an engine are to learn the best programming practices, improve my skills and make retro games.

Roadmap:
 * Deepen Win32 integration.
 * Design game engine artchitecture. Research is based on book "Game Engine Architecture" by Jason Gregory.
 * Deepen OpenGL intergration, maybe form some general interface for any rendering object in the game. Based on Beginning OpenGL Game Programming, 1st and 2nd editions.
